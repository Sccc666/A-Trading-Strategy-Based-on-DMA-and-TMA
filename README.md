A Trading Strategy Based on DMA and TMA

## Background
Moving Average (MA) was first proposed by the famous American investment expert Joseph E. Granville in the mid-20th century. The strategy builds a price curve using a moving average based on the average cost proposed by Dow Jones. While stabilizing short-term fluctuations in stock prices, it is trying to achieve profitability by capturing signals from trending stocks. Here, we use moving average to achieve profitability by capturing signals from trending crypto currencies.
